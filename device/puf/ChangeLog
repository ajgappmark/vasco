PIC USB Framework (1.2)

  * Clean up trailing white chars
  * Upgrade to sdcc 3.0.0 (more strict pointer type checking,
    cleaner licensing schema, _DEBUG sdcc bug still there so 
    introduce a workaround :-( )
  * Build optimization flags revisited.
  * Upgrade to odyssey 0.6
  * Upgrade to gputils 0.13.7
  * Implement preliminary GET_STATUS setup command.
  * Add --enable-bootloader-debugging option to configure. It
    enables bootloader runtime traces through USART serial interface.
    It also modifies the memory map to enlarge sections dedicated to
    the bootloader. This extra place is used to embed printf function 
    family. Handy for USB debugging :-)
  * Add automatic management of dependencies, as automake can not do
    it alone in this cross-compiling case (sdcc is not available at
    configure time).
  * Now automatically switch to the application if valid. SAFE_BOOT_BUTTON
    can be pressed to stop in the bootloader and load bootloader USB 
    configuration. SAFE_BOOT_BUTTON defaults to RB5 instead of RA1 (less 
    multiplexed). This way, USB is not anymore required to start the 
    application, that may even not be USB aware.
  * Upgrade automake to 1.9.11 and autoconf to 2.64.
  * Switch the whole code under Apache License 2.0, better adapted than LGPL
    to the context of a bootloader sharing code with the applications.

PIC USB Framework (1.1)

  * Upgrade to odyssey 0.5
  * sdcc optimization flags switched on by default
  * Add timer2 related functions to libpuf
  * Move boot_iface.[hc], usb.[hc], application_iface.h, common_types.h
    and debug.h to libpuf
  * Add a periodic tasks sequencer to libpuf
  * udev rule modified to take into account any Vasco device
  * Add picon (text console through USB) to lipuf.
  * Add a components library to help building user applications
  * UML model updated (due to new release of topcased-uml editor).
  * Upgrade of automake 1.9.6 and autoconf 2.59d.
  * Upgrade to sdcc snapshot 4482 and gputils 0.13.4.
  * The bootloader now exports the intrinsic functions used by the
    compiler. The mechanism used is the same as for the other shared
    functions. To improve extensibility of the indirection table,
    its address is now 0x1c instead of 0x1fd2 (too close to segment
    limit). sdcc shared functions are : _mullong, _mulint, _gptrget1, _gptrget2,
    _gptrget3, _gptrget4, _gptrput1, _gptrput2, _gptrput3, _delay10ktcy,
    _delay1ktcy, and _delay10tcy. In the case of picon, 270 program bytes
    are saved thanks to that method (close feature request #364).    
  * The return of the SET_CONFIGURATION bug... Configuration change is now
    effective after the null IN packet aknownledgment. Include a sdcc work
    around : for(i=1;i<16;i++) was "optimized" to for(i=14;i>=0;i--). So I 
    had to change this loop to for(i=15;i>0;i--) : close bug #397 once more... 
  * Build optimization flags revisited.

 PIC USB Framework (1.0)

  * License updated to LGPL 2.1 (close bug #366)
  * Interrupts are now supported (close feature request #362)
  * Application code can now access the USB states : device, alt_setting, 
    configuration (close bug #385)
  * Configuration of the bootloader is now centralized in config.h (close bug #386)
  * Bootloader USB functions are now used by default : reflash an application
    does not crash the device anymore. Functions are switched to the 
    application ones when switching to application configuration (close
    bug #387)
  * EP0, EP1 and EP2 buffers are not anymore at fixed addresses (close bug #389)
  * DEBUG mode is now disabled by default because it makes USB communications
    unstable. Moreover, application init has also been modified to improve the USB
    stability when _DEBUG is defined, even if it does not seem sufficient (close 
    bug #397)
