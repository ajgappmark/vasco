PIC USB Framework (1.1)

  * The return of the SET_CONFIGURATION bug. Configuration change is now effective
    after the null IN packet aknownledgment. Vectors switch and ep_init calls
    stay in ep0_usb_std_request because something does not work when it is done
    in ep0_in. I don't know why :-( close bug #397 once more... )

 PIC USB Framework (1.0)

  * License updated to LGPL 2.1 (close bug #366)
  * Interrupts are now supported (close feature request #362)
  * Application code can now access the USB states : device, alt_setting, 
    configuration (close bug #385)
  * Configuration of the bootloader is now centralized in config.h (close bug #386)
  * Bootloader USB functions are now used by default : reflash an application
    does not crash the device anymore. Functions are switched to the 
    application ones when switching to application configuration (close
    bug #387)
  * EP0, EP1 and EP2 buffers are not anymore at fixed addresses (close bug #389)
  * DEBUG mode is now disabled by default because it makes USB communications
    unstable. Moreover, application init has also been modified to improve the USB
    stability when _DEBUG is defined, even if it does not seem sufficient (close 
    bug #397)
