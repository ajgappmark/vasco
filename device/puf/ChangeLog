PIC USB Framework (1.1)

  * The bootloader now exports the intrinsic functions used by the
    compiler. The mechanism used is the same as for the other shared
    functions. To improve extensibility of the indirection table,
    its address is now 0x1c instead of 0x1fd2 (too close to segment
    limit). sdcc shared functions are : _mullong, _mulint, _gptrget1, _gptrget2,
    _gptrget3, _gptrget4, _gptrput1, _gptrput2, and _gptrput3. In the case of 
    picon, 270 program bytes are saved thanks to that method (close feature
    request #364).
    
  * The return of the SET_CONFIGURATION bug. Configuration change is now effective
    after the null IN packet aknownledgment. Vectors switch and ep_init calls
    stay in ep0_usb_std_request because something does not work when it is done
    in ep0_in. I don't know why :-( close bug #397 once more... ).

 PIC USB Framework (1.0)

  * License updated to LGPL 2.1 (close bug #366)
  * Interrupts are now supported (close feature request #362)
  * Application code can now access the USB states : device, alt_setting, 
    configuration (close bug #385)
  * Configuration of the bootloader is now centralized in config.h (close bug #386)
  * Bootloader USB functions are now used by default : reflash an application
    does not crash the device anymore. Functions are switched to the 
    application ones when switching to application configuration (close
    bug #387)
  * EP0, EP1 and EP2 buffers are not anymore at fixed addresses (close bug #389)
  * DEBUG mode is now disabled by default because it makes USB communications
    unstable. Moreover, application init has also been modified to improve the USB
    stability when _DEBUG is defined, even if it does not seem sufficient (close 
    bug #397)
